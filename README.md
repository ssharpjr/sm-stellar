-- 
-- Welcome to S.T.E.L.L.A.R.
-- 
-- The
-- System for
-- Tracking, 
-- Excavating, 
-- Locating, and 
-- Logistics of 
-- Astrological 
-- Resources
-- 
-- Release Version: 1.0
-- 
-- STELLAR Keeps a record of all mineable asteroids and harvestable gases that
-- you come across during your space traveling adventures.
-- 
-- Basic Functionality
-- STELLAR uses the output of the 'SHIP BEACON' command to populate a database
-- of Asteroids and Gases. STELLAR assigns a unique ID and timestamp to each
-- entity it finds. The timestamp allows you to know how long ago you scanned
-- that entity. Every time you scan the same entity, the timestamp updates,
-- keeping the record fresh. This way you will know if an entity is still
-- present if you fly within 50 spaces and the timestamp does not update.
-- 
-- Harvesting Asteroids
-- + When you scan and find an asteroid that is not in the STELLAR database, 
--    you will see a (NEW) tag beside it in the Beacon Entity Report and
--    it gets added to the database.
-- + When you 'SHIP PROBE ASTEROID' it, the results update the database 
--    and the Beacon Entity Report.
-- + If the asteroid has not been probed, you will see a (Not Identified) tag.
-- + If you are touching a non-tethered asteroid, you will see a (Not Tethered) tag.
-- + When you tether an asteroid, it is removed from the STELLAR database and 
--    marked as tethered in the Beacon Entity Report with 'in tow'.
-- + When you queue the asteroid at a refinery, it is removed from the STELLAR
--    system completely.
-- 
-- Harvesting Gas Clouds
-- + As with asteroids, new gas clouds are tagged with (NEW) in the Beacon
--    Entity Report.
-- + The gas collection tracking function is manual using the 'sreport' command
--    or your custom console output function. For each gas cloud record in the
--    STELLAR report, there is a 'C'. You must click this 'C' to Mark the cloud
--    for Collection. This will automatically remove the gas record once the
--    cloud is depleted.
-- + This is optional as you can always click the 'X' at the beginning of the
--    report to remove a record.
-- + When you queue the gas at a refinery, it is removed from the STELLAR
--    system completely.
-- 
-- STELLAR Report Features
-- + The STELLAR Report is accessed directly with the 'sreport' command.
--    It can also be displayed creatively in a MiniConsole.
--    (see 'Scripts -> STELLAR -> Example Console Output' for an example.)
-- + Here is a breakdown of the report.
-- 
--        Resource U  Zone    Location   Age
--      X Asteroid 20 Iota    (125, 125) 10m
--      X Titanium 20 Aleph   (100, 150) 10m
--      X Iriil    C  CA-3939 (10, 20)   10m
-- 
-- + X = Click to delete the record from the database.
-- + C = Click to mark a gas for collection.
-- + U = Mineable units (asteroids).
-- + Location can be clicked to set your Auto Pilot (SHIP TRAVEL TO).
-- + Age is the number of minutes/hours an entity has been in the database.
--    This changes the color the longer it's in the database.
-- 
-- 
-- Reporting Commands
-- + sreport - Shows the tracking report (usually sent to another console)
-- + hcheck  - Shows your current haul
-- 
-- Refining Commands
-- + refh    - Sends 'REFINERY LIST HERE' highlighting valid refineries
-- + refqa # - Sends 'REFINERY # QUEUE ASTEROID'
-- + refqg # - Sends 'REFINERY # QUEUE GAS'
-- 
-- Other Commands
-- + help stellar - Show STELLAR's Help System (this file)
-- + svars        - Show STELLAR's variables
-- + sshowdb      - Show STELLAR's database (table dump)
-- + svarsreset   - Resets STELLAR by clearing its variables
-- + scleardb     - Deletes the STELLAR database
