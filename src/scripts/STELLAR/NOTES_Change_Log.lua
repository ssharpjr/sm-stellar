-- STELLAR Change Log

-- Version v0.2-beta
  -- 2019-DEC-22
  -- Updated all variables to be prefixed with 'STELLAR.', creating isolation to this package.
  -- Removed integration hooks for my personal UI (hopefully all of them), allowing this package to stand alone.
  -- Corrected STELLAR Ship Beacon Capture issues (removed links to another package in progress).
  -- Updated HELP STELLAR information.
  -- Started adding refinery report support for hauling both asteroids and gas at the same time.
  -- Cleaned up various minor bugs in triggers, aliases, and scripts.
